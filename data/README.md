# Synthetic demo data

`demo.csv`: 600 mathematical simulations with patient IDs and binary labels. `examples.csv`: five unlabeled rows for inference. `schema.json`: simulator specification. `data_dictionary.json`: per-field semantics. `split_manifest.json`: patient membership for seed 42.

Five cohort_seed CSVs are independent 120-row simulator draws. Five domain_sample CSVs illustrate raw signals or temporal records and are not linked to training-table patients. No real patient data. Target: simulated_rhythm_class. These values are not validated physiologic reference ranges.
