# Calibration

Quantile reliability bins and equal-width expected calibration error are descriptive tools. The package does not automatically recalibrate models. Fit a calibrator only with a separate training/validation protocol; do not fit it on held-out test labels.

Project context: Synthetic ECG rhythm classification. See `data/schema.json` for the feature contract and `README.md` for executable commands.
