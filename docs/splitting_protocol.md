# Splitting protocol

GroupShuffleSplit assigns approximately 60% of patient groups to train, 20% to validation and 20% to test. Repeated patient rows remain together. This is not temporal or site-external validation. For deployment research, substitute an appropriate temporal and external protocol before model development.

Project context: Synthetic ECG rhythm classification. See `data/schema.json` for the feature contract and `README.md` for executable commands.
